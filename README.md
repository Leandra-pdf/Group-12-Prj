This project is called 'Notify!'.
Notify is a chrome extension that has a matryoshka doll tell you the title of the current page on your browser.

This repo consist of two image folders, three javascript files, two css files, and one html file (as well as this read me file):

    - background.js
    - notify.js
    - popup.js
    - popup.css
    - content.css
    - popup.html 

There is no need to download anything for it to work. Just clone the repo, load the pack in your chrome extensions, and then pin it so you have easy access to it. 

There are a few commands to try 
    'alt shift 2' - keyboard short cut to run the extension 
    'alt shift 3' - runs extension on the bottom right of your page 
                    (It works better when your page is full screen.)


Enjoy!
